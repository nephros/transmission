The rpm/ sub directory contains multiple .spec files.

This makes OBS ususally complain if you use the tar_git service.
The solution is to create one OBS package for each .spec file, and use the same _service file in each of those packages.

So:

    project: transmission
        package: transmission
            _service
        package: dht
            _service
        package: upnpc
            _service

and the _service git url points to the same git repo
